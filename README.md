# Code samples written in Python and C
Samples of my assignments for CS50, written in Python and C

## Speller (written in C)
--------------
| Specification          |Answer       |
|-------------------|-----------------:|
| Implement a Dictionary in C. Includes memory management, file reading and hash tables. | [Source code](https://github.com/dougweltman/CS50-items/blob/main/dictionary.c) |

## Final Project: Quadratic Voting (written in Python / Flask)
--------------
| Specification          |Answer       |
|-------------------|-----------------:|
| Early version of my project [Quadratick](www.quadratick.com), which I submitted as my final project for CS50. This does reuse some Flask code from CS50's Finance, so any shortcomings are entirely the fault of CS50's staff. | [Source code](https://github.com/dougweltman/CS50-items/blob/main/quadratic.py) |
