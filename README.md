# Code samples written in Python and C
Samples of my assignments for CS50, written in Python and C

## Speller (written in C)
--------------
Implements a Dictionary in C. Includes memory management, file reading and hash tables. | [Source code](https://github.com/dougweltman/CS50-items/blob/main/dictionary.c)


## Readability: Calculating a passage's readability (written in Python)
--------------
Short exercise that takes as input a sentence and outputs the approxmate reading level. | [Source code](https://github.com/dougweltman/CS50-items/blob/main/readability.py)


##DNA: Identifying matching genomes using short tandem repeats (written in Python)
--------------
Compares a snippet of DNA and matches it to a .csv file that gives individuals and the counts of their short tandem repeats (STRs). | [Source code](https://github.com/dougweltman/CS50-items/blob/main/dna.py)


## Final Project: Quadratic Voting (written in Python / Flask)
--------------
Early version of my project [Quadratick](www.quadratick.com), which I submitted as my final project for CS50. This does reuse some Flask code from CS50's Finance, so any shortcomings are entirely the fault of CS50's staff. | [Source code](https://github.com/dougweltman/CS50-items/blob/main/quadratic.py)
